These are my dotfiles.. i keep them here to have them accesable whenever i need them, also backup.. ;)

Some stuff is written by me.. customize if you like. 
The vim stuff is from the 'Smash into vim' Screencast (see https://peepcode.com/products/smash-into-vim-i for further details) i highly recommend it it you're new to vim!
