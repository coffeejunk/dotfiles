These are my dotfiles.. i keep them here to have them accesable whenever i need them, also backup.. ;)

Some stuff is written by me.. customize if you like. 
The vim stuff is from the 'Smash into vim' Screencast (see https://peepcode.com/products/smash-into-vim-i for further details) i highly recommend it it you're new to vim!






If you want to use MacVim as your standard editor for Mac OSX (i.e. open all files with no file-extension) you need to remove the TextEdit.app and symlink MacVim.app to TextEdit.app. The only thing that doesn't work somehow is "open -e file". However you can simply use mvim. :)
